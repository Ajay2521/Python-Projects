Thus by using that num parameter the for loop is iterated for the range of num to get num number of values from user. \n    \n    In simple this function is used to get notes one by one from user till user required value get satisfied.\n    \n### print_notes(name_given,notes_given):\n\n    In this by passing out the name and notes, by using the enumerated for loop the notes were printed one by one.\n    \n### save_notes(name_given,notes_given):\n\n    In this by passing out the name and notes, a file with the given name is created with \".txt\" extension with mode as write mode. Then by using enumerated for loop with file write() the notes will be writen into the file one by one.\n    \n### main()\n\n    This is the main function of the program which is used to call every other function which is created before. Initially it get user name and then number of notes user needed. then by passing number of nodes to note_creation() the user notes will be created and by passing the user name and user notes into print_notes() and save_notes() the notes will be printed and saved by using the user name. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PROGRAM SOURCE CODE","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile sticky_note.py\n\n'''\npython program for creating our own sticky notes\n'''\n\ndef note_creation(num):\n    '''\n    function for creating notes from user.\n    '''\n    notes = []\n    for i in range(1,num+1):\n        note = input(\"\\nEnter your Note - {} :\".format(i))\n        notes.append(note)\n    return notes\n\ndef print_notes(name_given,notes_given):\n    '''\n    function to print the sticky notes.\n    '''\n    print()\n    print(name_given.capitalize(),\"- here is your Sticky Notes\")\n    for i,note_given in enumerate(notes_given,1):\n        print(\"\\nNote\",i,\"-\",note_given)\n\ndef save_notes(name_given,notes_given):\n    '''\n    function to save the yours stickynote as txt file.\n    '''\n    file_name = \"%s_Sticky_Notes.txt\" %name_given.capitalize()\n    file = open(file_name, \"w\")\n    file.write(\"\\n{} - here is your Sticky Notes\".format(name_given.capitalize()))\n    for i,note_given in enumerate(notes_given,1):\n        file.write(\"\\n\\nNote {} - {}\".format((i),note_given))\n    file.close()\n    print(\"\\nFILE HAS BEEN SAVED SUCCESSFULLY...\")\n\ndef main():\n    '''\n    function which is used to call other functions.\n    '''\n    print(\"\\nCREATE YOUR OWN STICKY NOTES...\")\n    user_name = input(\"\\nEnter your Name - \")\n    notes_num = int(input(\"\\nEnter number of notes needed - \"))\n    user_notes = note_creation(notes_num)\n    print_notes(user_name,user_notes)\n    print()\n    save_notes(user_name,user_notes)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Overwriting sticky_note.py\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Testing file standard using pylint","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"! pylint \"sticky_note.py\"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n------------------------------------\nYour code has been rated at 10.00/10\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing the file and main() to make our program file works","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing the file string_note.py as module with alias name \"sn\"\n\nimport sticky_note as sn","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calling the main() to make work of our program\n\nsn.main()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nCREATE YOUR OWN STICKY NOTES...\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"\nEnter your Name -  AJAY\n\nEnter number of notes needed -  5\n\nEnter your Note - 1 : Pain killer\n\nEnter your Note - 2 : Sleeping pill\n\nEnter your Note - 3 : First aid kit\n\nEnter your Note - 4 : Food\n\nEnter your Note - 5 : Water\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nAjay - here is your Sticky Notes\n\nNote 1 - Pain killer\n\nNote 2 - Sleeping pill\n\nNote 3 - First aid kit\n\nNote 4 - Food\n\nNote 5 - Water\n\n\nFILE HAS BEEN SAVED SUCCESSFULLY...\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## verify the program ouput by opening the file created.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# verifing whethere the program is excuted arrocding by opening the file created while working in the program dynamically.\n\nverify = open(\"Ajay_Sticky_Notes.txt\")\n\nprint(verify.read())","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nAjay - here is your Sticky Notes\n\nNote 1 - Pain killer\n\nNote 2 - Sleeping pill\n\nNote 3 - First aid kit\n\nNote 4 - Food\n\nNote 5 - Water\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
